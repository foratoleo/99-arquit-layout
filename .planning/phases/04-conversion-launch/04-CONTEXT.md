# Phase 4: Conversion & Launch - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-02-10
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Complete conversion paths, validate performance targets, deploy to production with final content. This phase adds WhatsApp and contact form conversion elements, validates performance, deploys to Vercel, and replaces all placeholder content.

## Implementation Decisions

### WhatsApp Button Design
- **Position**: Claude's choice — optimal position for visibility and aesthetics
- **Size**: Claude's choice — balanced size for desktop and mobile
- **Appearance**: Claude's choice — luxury-appropriate design with WhatsApp icon
- **Animation timing**: Claude's choice — when button first appears and animation behavior

### Contact Form Behavior
- **Form fields**: Minimal (3 fields) — Name, Email, Message only
- **Form style**: Understated luxury — minimal borders, subtle labels
- **Success feedback**: Inline message — thank you message replaces form
- **Error handling**: Field-level — inline field-level errors

### Performance Testing Approach
- **Testing tools**: All three tools — PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, WebPageTest
- **Device testing**: Claude's choice — appropriate testing method for mobile
- **Target baseline**: Claude's choice — appropriate device performance baseline
- **Success threshold**: Claude's choice — performance score thresholds for launch

### Content Handoff Process
- **Copy delivery**: Claude's choice — coordinated method for PT-BR copy delivery
- **Image delivery**: Claude's choice — coordinated method for project photography delivery
- **Image specs**: Claude's choice — how images should be prepared
- **Revision process**: Claude's choice — number of content revision rounds

## Specific Ideas

- WhatsApp button is primary CTA — most important conversion element
- Honeypot anti-spam on contact form (no CAPTCHA to disrupt luxury feel)
- Performance targets: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, PageSpeed >= 90
- Deployment to Vercel with custom domain and technical SEO

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope.
