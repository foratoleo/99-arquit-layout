# Phase 2: Core Sections - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-02-10
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Build the main content sections from top to bottom with LCP optimization. This phase creates Hero, Manifesto, Technical Differentiator, and Materiality sections as the page's core content structure.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero Section Structure
- **Elements**: Minimal 4 elements — Logo, headline, subheadline, CTA button
- **Layout**: Centered text, symmetrical, classic luxury
- **Motion**: Subtle fade — fade-in + subtle vertical slide on load
- **Background**: Fullscreen architecture image (full-bleed)

### Single-Page Navigation
- **Header behavior**: Sticky header — always visible at top
- **Nav items**: Section links only — just section names (Manifesto, Portfolio, Contato)
- **Scroll behavior**: Smooth scroll anchors — click section name, smooth scroll to it
- **Section transitions**: Subtle fade reveals — cross-fade as sections enter viewport

### Manifesto Content Approach
- **Writing style**: Poetic philosophy — short, poetic, philosophy-focused
- **Content length**: Ultra-short — 3-4 powerful sentences
- **Visual treatment**: Typographic focus — large serif type, very spacious
- **Placement**: Second section — immediately below hero

### Technical Differentiator Presentation
- **Visual focus**: Technical visuals — technical diagrams, cross-sections showing expertise
- **Content format**: Problem-solution format — why vertical construction matters, challenges, solutions
- **Layout**: Split layout — text on one side, supporting visual on other
- **Detail level**: Accessible overview — high-level for non-technical audience

## Specific Ideas

- Hero CTA should drive to WhatsApp or Portfolio section
- Manifesto should feel like a whisper, not a shout
- Technical differentiator establishes authority without being overly technical
- Materiality section placeholder will be replaced with macro photography later

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope.
